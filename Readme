This is a sample web server built using the rust-http library from Chris Morgan (http://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http).

It shows a small demo of serving a number of static files, and returning 404 errors for non-existant files.

There are many things lacking here yet, such as checking that the url points to a file, not directory, etc, but this is a small start.
